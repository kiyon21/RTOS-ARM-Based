# **ARM-Based Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) 🚀**

## **Overview**
This project is a **real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for ARM-based processors**, built from scratch in **C and ARM Assembly**. It provides **preemptive, priority-based scheduling**, **memory management**, **inter-process communication (IPC) through message passing**, and **real-time task execution**.

The RTOS is developed as part of an **embedded systems project** to demonstrate **low-level system programming, task scheduling, and kernel design**.

## **Features** 🛠️
- ✅ **Preemptive, priority-based multitasking** with a custom scheduler.
- ✅ **Task management API** for creating, scheduling, and terminating tasks.
- ✅ **Memory management** with dynamic allocation and deallocation.
- ✅ **Message-passing IPC** using mailboxes for inter-task communication.
- ✅ **System initialization and task control mechanisms**.
- ✅ **Hardware interrupt handling** for real-time task execution.
